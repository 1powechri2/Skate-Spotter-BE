# Skate-Spotter-BE

Skate-Spotter-BE is an api that interacts with a database designed to store specific information for an app that allows skateboarders to share their favorite skate spots. The idea is that, architecturally, there are more fun places to skateboard and these places can now be shared across an online community.

## EndPoints
#### *For Security reasons there is not a link to the deployed db but if you fork and clone this repo you can use these endpoints to create your own skate spot database api and even add more features as well

1. `/api/v1/spots`
    This endpoint gives you all the spots in the db.
