## Cross-Pollination DTR

#### Group Members: Brandon Fiebiger, Chris Powell, Kurt Miller

### What do we want to takeaway from this project?

Brandon Fiebiger - I wanted to get better as using React Native, become familiar with Python and how to incorporate camera shot technology
into a real world application

Chris - I want to be able to easily integrate a tech stack that I'm not as familiar with specifically React and Python/Flask.

Kurt - I want to become comfortable with building a mobile application using React Native and learn more about backend architecture.

### When will we meet as a group? Retro?

We will meet most days (including weekends) and communicate often via Slack. We plan on having brief retros to gauge each other's progress
every day once worktime starts.

### What roles do we want in this project?

Chris - In charge of databasing and backend architecture.

Brandon - Working in tandem with Kurt on React/Redux frontend; keep in touch with Chris and help with backend as well if needed.
